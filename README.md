# Sandwich Command Line

A command line interface to interact with a local sandwich server.

The [sandwich-go](https://github.com/sandwich-share/sandwich-go) server/client
starts up a local webserver on port 9001 (By default). This will give you a
command line interface to that to allow you to search/download/etc... without
a browser.
